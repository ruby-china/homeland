# OneApm RubyAgent Configuration

# Here are the settings that are common to all environments
common: &default_settings
  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================

  #
  # Get your license key from oneapm.com
  #
  license_key: 'VwIDBU4MRe231VoOHlhBVVbb06RIB1UDBhxb264SVB0HVR4E98d5BQgNSQVQHwEF'

  # Agent Enabled (Ruby/Rails Only)
  # Valid values are true, false and auto.
  #
  # agent_enabled: auto

  # This app_name will be the application name in oneapm.com in your account.
  #
  # Caution: If you change this name, a new application will appear in the OneApm
  # user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the
  # app with the old name.
  #
  app_name: Ruby China

  # When "true", the agent collects performance data about your
  # application and reports this data to the OneApm service at
  # oneapm.com. This global switch is normally overridden for each
  # environment below. (formerly called 'enabled')
  monitor_mode: true

  # Specify its log level here.
  log_level: info

  # log_file_path: 'log'
  # log_file_name: 'oneapm_agent.log'

  # The oneapm agent communicates with the service via https by default.
  # ssl: true

  # ======================== Browser Monitoring =============================
  browser_monitoring:
    # By default the agent automatically injects the monitoring JavaScript
    # into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior.
    auto_instrument: true

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the OneApm server.
  #
  # proxy_host: hostname
  # proxy_port: 8080
  # proxy_user:
  # proxy_pass:

  # Tells transaction tracer and error collector (when enabled)
  # whether or not to capture HTTP params.  When true, frameworks can
  # exclude HTTP parameters from being captured.
  # Rails: the RoR filter_parameter_logging excludes parameters
  capture_params: false

  # Transaction tracer captures deep information about slow
  # transactions and sends this to the OneApm service once a
  # minute. Included in the transaction is the exact call sequence of
  # the transactions including any SQL statements issued.
  transaction_tracer:

    # Transaction tracer is enabled by default.
    enabled: true

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction
    # trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds
    # this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to
    # OneApm. Valid values are any float value, or (default) "apdex_f",
    # which will use the threshold for an dissatisfying Apdex
    # controller action - four times the Apdex T value.
    transaction_threshold: apdex_f

    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be
    # recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off" which sends no
    # SQL, "raw" which sends the SQL statement in its original form,
    # and "obfuscated", which strips out numeric and string literals.
    record_sql: obfuscated

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL
    # call. In other words, when SQL statements exceed this threshold,
    # then capture and send to OneApm the current stack trace. This is
    # helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from.
    stack_trace_threshold: 0.200

    # Determines whether the agent will capture query plans for slow
    # SQL queries.  Only supported in mysql and postgres.  Should be
    # set to false when using other adapters.
    # explain_enabled: true

    # Threshold for query execution time below which query plans will
    # not be captured.  Relevant only when `explain_enabled` is true.
    # explain_threshold: 0.5

  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and
  # sends them to OneApm for viewing
  error_collector:

    # Error collector is enabled by default.
    enabled: true

    # Ignore the following errors, add your own.
    ignore_errors: "ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound,Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound,ActionController::BadRequest,ActionView::MissingTemplate,ActionController::UnknownFormat"

# ===================== Application Environments ========================
# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
# For Rails applications, RAILS_ENV is used to determine the environment.

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide oneapm configuration settings for these environments here.

development:
  <<: *default_settings
  # Turn on communication to OneApm service in development mode
  monitor_mode: true
  app_name: Ruby China (Development)

test:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: false

# Turn on the agent in production for 24x7 monitoring.
production:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true

# Staging environment which behaves identically to production.
staging:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true
  app_name: Ruby China (Staging)
