/*
 * Pool memory allocation
 *
 */

// not thread safe (a pool cannot be shared by threads safely)

/*
-- principle:

 - user operations on a pool of objects of type T are:
   - T *draw() : obtain a unused slot to store an object T
   - void drop(T *) : realease a slot

-- implementation:

 - a pool for objects T is:

   * blocks[64] : an array of allocated blocks of memory:
     |---0--> block with capacity 64
     |---1--> block with capacity 64
     |---2--> block with capacity 128
     |---3--> block with capacity 128
     |---4--> block with capacity 256
     |---5--> block with capacity 256
     |---6--> block with capacity 512
     |---7--> not yet allocated
     :
     |---k--> not yet allocated (future capacity ~ 2^(6+k/2))
     :
     '--63--> not yet allocated
   * cblock : the index of the next unallocated block (here 7).
   * next : a pointer to an unused slot inside an allocated bloc

 - the first bytes of an unallocated slot inside a bloc are used to store a
   pointer to some other unallocated slot. (this way, we keep a list of all
   unused slots starting at <next>)

 - insertions and deletions in this list are done at the root <next>.
   if <next> points to NULL (no slots are availlable) when a draw()
   operation is performed a new block is allocated, and the unused slots
   list is filled with the allocated slots.

 - memory is freed only at pool's deletion.
